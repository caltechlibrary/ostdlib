## Someday Maybe

+ Add mechanism so purely JavaScript defined objects can be added to Help, AutoComplete dynamically
+ Add a Workbook global object the wraps xlsx go routines with additional DOM like features
    + Look at Google's Sheets API for interesting things to add
+ setTimeout() and setInterval() are missing, see https://github.com/robertkrimen/natto for possible implementation
+ Add support for "require" command to load additional JavaScript modules like with NodeJS
+ Asynchronous http implementation following NodeJS http object
+ Asynchronous read/write for xlsx object
+ Add a map/reduce ability to xlsx objects
+ Review https://github.com/deoxxa/ottoext and see what might be relavant for ostdlib
