## Bugs

+ History file is always .ottomatic_history and should be named after the program where otto is embedded
+ otto is missing Number.parseInt() see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt for polyfill

## Someday Maybe

+ Make sure I can run JS generated from GopherJS
    + Support typed arrays (e.g. Unit8Array)
