This project has been depreciated as the JavaScript implementations common in web browsers and NodeJS (ES6) have are diveraging from the implementation provided for in [Otto](https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto) (ES5). Otto remains under active developement (as Oct 2016) and the need for this library has deminished as a result even where ES5 support remains desirable.
